- basics of a wiki: add, edit, view page
- add file upload
- wiki and wiki/ should be the same.
- figure out line break in content
- BUG: enter in contenteditable
- turn off spell check
- edit only when clicking edit button, not when highlighting text, same with save.
- include one image
- save to disk
- idea: keyboard as interface. type to highlight words, go to pages, edit etc. that'd be pretty cool. not far from google search-and-resp.
...why anything else?
- save notes there? that'd be cool.

don't get ahead of yourself!
